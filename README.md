# Discord Terminal - Discord.js

I had the question if it could be allowed to have a Discord chat in your Terminal and I did not find answers, I only found codes that worked by the server but not by the user so I decided to create one
# Start

To start the server

    npm start

To start development

    npm run dev

## Configuration file (.env)

In order to complete the file if or if a Discord Bot is needed, you will have to put your token in the token section and in the REMITENT_ID you put the id of the person to whom you are going to speak


    TOKEN=
    PREFIX=!
    REMITENT_ID=
